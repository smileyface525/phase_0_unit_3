# Databases, SQL, and Schemas

You've played with classes quite a bit at this point. Have you ever thought of storing data about a specific thing, for example, songs and playlists in a database? Wouldn't that be a nice change? This week you get to start looking at SQL and database relationships. 

If you aren't familiar with databases, please take some time to watch the videos listed in the resources (below) before working through the challenges. 

Make sure to attend GPS 3.1 this week! Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/intro_gps_signup.md) to sign up. 

## Challenges
1. Install SQLite on your computer - Research how to do this and ask your cohort mates for help!
2. [SQLZoo for SQL Queries](1_SQLzoo)
3. [Designing Schemas](2_designing_schemas) 
4. [Modeling a One to Many Database - SOLO CHALLENGE](3_model_one_to_many_solo_challenge)
5. [Intro to SQLite](4_intro_to_SQLite)
6. [Technical Blog](5_technical_blog.md)
7. [Cultural Blog](6_cultural_blog.md)
8. [GPS 3.1](7_gps3.1) **DO NOT LOOK UNTIL YOUR GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!**
9. [BONUS: Using the SQLite Gem](8_SQLite_gem) 


## Submitting your work
**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 3 Week 7 Submission" form.**

This week you will be storing your reflections in the challenge files in this repository. 
- Fork this (phase_0_unit_3) repository by clicking "Fork" at the top right of the page. 
- Under settings (in the right navigation bar) check the box next to "issues" under "features." This will allow people
  to give you feedback.
- Open your GitHub desktop app. Find the `phase_0_unit_3` repository and click "clone to computer." 

When you make updates to the files on your local repo, you should commit your work the same way you did for your other repos through the app. Include a commit message like "added pseudocode and initial solution for add it up."

**NOTE: Sometimes we will make changes to the original repository to clarify instructions. You will need to fetch these changes from the master branch when we announce changes on the google+ community.**
- If you are doing this from the Github Desktop App, follow [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client
)
directions. 
- If you are doing it from the command line, follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) directions.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the 'my_solution.rb' files or the spec files. 

When you make updates to the files (or add a file), you should commit your work the same way you did for your website through the app. Include a commit message that describes what you've changed.


## Remember your Unit Goals!
- Pair at least once this week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair **4** times this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit* (4 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.
