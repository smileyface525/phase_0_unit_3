# U3.W7: GPS 3.1 Create an Electronic Grocery List

## Learning Competencies:
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Identify the attributes and methods of a class based on user stories
- Identify tradeoffs between simple OO design patterns

## Summary
In this challenge, you will create an electronic grocery list command-line application. Show off the object-oriented design principles you learned last week. You should spend time discussing tradeoffs with different designs. This is your grocery list, so get creative and have fun, but also make it great code!


## Release 0: User Stories
With your partner, talk about what you would like to do with your grocery list. Start each statement with "As a user, I want to ..." These are what we call "user stories." 

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](../../references/pseudocode.md)
What objects, classes, and methods will you need to do each of the things you identified in your user stories?

## Release 2: Write [Driver Code](../../references/driver_code.md)
Translate your pseudocode into driver code. 
Write driver code at the bottom (to call the method on the object). 

## Release 3: [Initial Solution](../../references/initial_solution.md)
Create your initial solution. 

## Release 4: [Refactor](../../references/refactoring.md) your solution
With your partner, review the code. Is it DRY? Are the names good?

## Release 5: [Reflect](../../references/reflection.md)
Copy your code from stypi into the [our_solution.rb](our_solution.rb) file. Then complete a reflection in the designated section. 

## Release 6: Sync your changes to Github!

## Release 6: Submit [Feedback](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new).
