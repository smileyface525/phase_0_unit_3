#U3.W8-9: A Gradebook from Names and Scores

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Define functions in JavaScript 
- Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values in object literals


## Summary
For this challenge, assume there is a teacher with a list of students and a list of their respective test scores.  The teacher is providing you with this data which looks like ...

```javascript
var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]
```


You will take this data and transform it into a grade book.  The grade book will be a JavaScript Object object.

Follow the steps below to make the tests pass and complete the challenge in your [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file.  The order of the steps 
corresponds to the order of the tests.  After completing each step, run your code to be certain that the next test has passed.

## Release 0: Create a variable `average`
Assign it the value of a function... 

## Release 1: Modify `average`
Have `average` accept an array of numbers and returns the average of those numbers

## Release 2: Create `gradebook`
The variable `gradebook` and assign it the value of a new object

## Release 3: Add property to `gradebook`
Make each student name in students a property of gradebook and assign each the value of a new object.

## Release 4: `testScores`
Give each student property of gradebook its own testScores property and assign it the value of the respective students scores from scores.

## Release 5: `addScore`
- addScore property to gradebook (assign it the value of a function that accepts name and score arguments)
- Have it push the score to the value of the testScore property of the gradebook property that matches the value of the name argument.  

For example, 
```javascript
    gradebook.addScore("Susan", 80) // would push the score 80 into the value of gradebook.Susan.testScores.
```
## Release 6: `getAverage`
A getAverage property to gradebook and assign it the value of a function ...

## Release 7: Modify `getAverage`
So that it accepts a name as a String (e.g., "Joseph") and returns the named students average.

## Release 9: [Reflect](../../../references/reflection.md)
