#U3.W8-9: Create a Cheat Sheet

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML tags to place content on a website
- Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page
- Illustrate fundamentals of web design and user experience in your website

## Summary:
At some point during Phase 0, you've probably desired a handy cheat sheet that would have all the information you've ever wanted on a topic, in a simple form. Well, they do exist, but they aren't as good as the cheat sheet you would make. So, here is your chance to create a one-page cheat sheet on any Phase 0 topic. You can use these later for reference as you go through Dev Bootcamp!

Suggestion: Pair with someone to complete this challenge. Two brains are better than one!

## Release 0: Select a topic for a cheatsheet
 - Ruby BASICS
 - Ruby Enumerables
 - Ruby Hashes, Arrays, Strings, Integers
 - JavaScript Objects
 - JavaScript prototypes
 - Looping in Ruby and Javascript (comparisons)
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - GIT
 - SQL
 - Your own awesome topic!

## Release 1: Wireframe your website
Create a wireframe for your website. You can do it on paper or using a resource. Take an image and upload it into [this](./) directory.

## Release 2: Create the HTML template
Create a new file in your github.io repository called `unit3_cheatsheet.html`

Design your site with the idea that you and your cohort-mates are the clients. How would you want a cheat-sheet to look to be effective as you go through Dev Bootcamp?

Consider the various ways you can present the information in HTML. Do you want to use `<div>`s, tables, or something else? What makes the most sense for what you are doing? Follow best practices and reserve formatting for your CSS file!

Once you create the template, start adding your information. You can copy and paste from any website or create your own. 

## Release 3: Implement your design
Now that you have the HTML and content in your site, make it appealing using CSS (create a custom CSS file for this assignment). Have fun with it, but keep in mind it should also be an effective learning tool.

## Release 4: Commit and Sync
Link to your new Cheatsheet from the index of your github.io website. 

##Optimize your learning: Compile!
It's great to have all these handy cheat sheets, but wouldn't it be even better to have them handy in one place for Phase 1?  Compile your favorite cheat sheets and compile them into one website. What are the challenges that emerge from using different CSS stylesheets? Do you need to select one or can you use different sheets? Share the website with your fellow cohort-mates.
