## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
	it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
	Apostrophes souble be replaced with HTML entities.
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 
	Some attribute values were not wrapped in double quotes. For expample, IDs, aligns, 

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
	Unnecessary<td>tags(line 329)
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
	A separate css file was included in the head. However, the page was also formatted
	in the html file by using <table>tags. 
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
	A shotcut to an icon caled favicon.
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
	Looks dry but seems like it could've been orgainzed better so it's easier to track.
	Perhaps by the order of appearence?
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
	Some Javascript is included in the HTML file but it only defines functions
	and I don't see those functions actually used in the body.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
	To me, it looks good and the script is simple enough for me to understand but
	there are some unnecessary script that can be eliminated.
	Also, almost the whole body is formatted using <table> to me, it looks like <li>
	may have been more appropriate.
