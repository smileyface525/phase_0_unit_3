## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
