#U3.W8-9: Evaluate a Website's HTML and CSS

## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate a website in terms of design and user experience
- Refactor for clarity and readability
- Identify and use web standards, semantic mark up, and HTML5

## Summary:
It's judgin' time!  Now's the time to see if you can evaluate a websites HTML and CSS based on what you've learned thus far. For this challenge, let's review [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news). 

## Release 0: Create new files
Create an `index.html` and css stylesheet. Copy the website's HTML and CSS stylesheets into the files. 

## Release 1: Read the Code
Read through the HTML and CSS to understand what each line is doing.  You may notice that Hacker News has compressed their files to eliminate all white space.  This makes the page load faster, but is a nightmare to read!

Luckily, the sublime editor can help you reformat the HTML and CSS.  Google it and then save your reformatted code.  (Again, you'll need to save the files with the right extension (`.html` or `.css`) for sublime to reformat correctly).

## Release 2: Answer [the questions](my_solution.md)
Remember that other students will be reading your answers, so write for an audience!

## Release 3: [Reflect](../../../references/reflection.md)
