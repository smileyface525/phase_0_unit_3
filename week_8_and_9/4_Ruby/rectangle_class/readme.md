#U3.W8-9: Implement a Rectangle Class

## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and hashes

## Summary:
In this challenge, you will want to create four instance methodes for a rectangle:

- `Rectangle#area`, which returns the area of the rectangle
- `Rectangle#perimeter`, which returns the perimeter of the rectangle
- `Rectangle#diagonal`, which returns the length of the rectangle's diagonal as a `Float`
- `Rectangle#square?`, which returns a boolean


## Release 0: Run the [Tests](rectangle_spec.rb)

## Release 1: Translate Rspec
Translate Rspec into Assert Statements or [Driver Test Code](../../../references/driver_code.md)

## Release 2: Write [Pseudocode](../../../references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 3: Write your [initial solution](../../../references/initial_solution.md)

## Release 4: [Refactor](../../../references/refactoring.md)

## Release 5: [Reflect](../../../references/reflection.md)

## Release 6: [Review](../../../references/review.md)
