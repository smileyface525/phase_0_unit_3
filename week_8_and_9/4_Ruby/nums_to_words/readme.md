#U3.W8-9: Numbers to English Words

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and hashes

## Summary:

Write a program that takes a number and returns it's english equivalent. 

Start with numbers up to 100. If you feel like stretching, go as high as you would like. 

Examples:

```ruby
in_words(4)         # => "four" 
in_words(27)       # => "twenty seven"  
in_words(92)       # => "ninety two"  
```

Either write your own Assert Statements or [Driver Test Code](../../../references/driver_code.md)
You definitely don't want to have to check all the possible cases. Make sure you are testing all of the irregular numbers.
