#U3.W8-9: What the Scope?! 

## Learning Competencies
- Explain what code is doing
- Idenitfy the scope of variables
- Write driver test code

## Summary:
Sometimes you'll run into some *seriously* messy code. In this challenge, your goal is to understand, test, and explain some of that absurdly awful code.


## Release 0: Run the Code
What errors are you getting? Note them so you can fix them in Release 1. 

## Release 1: Modify the Code
Modify the code so all variables are accessible within the code when needed (ie make the code run).  For each modification add a comment in the code that states what you modified and why.

## Release 2: Identify the Scope
For each variable, identify the scope. Include the scope of each variable as a comment. 

```ruby
# 1. var_1 is a ........... variable which means ......
```

## Release 3: Write [Driver Test Code](../../../references/driver_code.md) or Assert Statements
## Release 4: [Reflect](../../../references/reflect.md)
