#U3.W8-9: Fibonacci Number?

## Learning Competencies
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on challenge requirements
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges

## Summary:
There are some interesting mathematical sequences that appear in nature. The [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is one of them. For this challenge, you will write a method to check if a number is part of that sequence. 

There are many ways to do this, but you'll first have to understand how the sequence is built. 

## Release 0: Run the [Tests](fibonacci_spec.rb)

## Release 1: Translate Rspec
Translate Rspec into Assert Statements or [Driver Test Code](../../../references/driver_code.md)

## Release 2: Write [Pseudocode](../../../references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 3: Write your [initial solution](../../../references/initial_solution.md)

## Release 4: [Refactor](../../../references/refactoring.md)

## Release 5: [Reflect](../../../references/reflection.md)

## Release 6: [Review](../../../references/review.md)
