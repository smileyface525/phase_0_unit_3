#U3.W8-9: Triangle Debugger

## Learning Competencies
- Explain what code is doing
- Use error messages to correct syntax mistakes and/or drive development

## Summary:

Debugging is an art, and some weeks you will likely spend most of your time debugging as opposed to actual coding.  In this challenge, we'll explore some common errors and slow things down by listing the error, it's line number, and an educated guess why the error is occurring.  

## Release 0: Run the [tests](triangle_spec.rb)

## Release 1: Consider

For each bug (there are three initial bugs that cause interpreter errors), consider the following questions:
- Do you have enough information to decipher the problem? 
- Is the error message referencing a line in your file, or a different file?
- Is there a methodology that you are following to systematically tackle these bugs?  What is your first step?

There are questions to answer for each bug on you [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file. 

## Release 2: Answer the questions for each initial bug
- What is the exact description of the error?
- What is the exact line number the error is appearing?
- Before you fix the bug, what do you think is causing the error?

## Release 3: Make the code pass
Modify the code to make it pass the tests. After you've fixed the first three bugs, you'll need to dive a little deeper to fix the last bug to make it pass the the Socrates RSpec tests.

## Release 4: [Refactor](../../../references/refactoring.md)

## Release 5: [Reflect](../../../references/reflection.md)
