#U3.W9: Hang Out with your Cohort!!!

## Summary:
By the weekend before Phase 1, most of your cohort should be in town. Get together and get to know each other! You can arrange it using your community or email lists, but definitely try to get together. You can even get together to code in person!

Have fun getting to know everyone!

No it's not an official challenge or requirement, but it's a good idea. =)
